# Smart Aeroponics using Random Forest
This project integrates Automation and Machine learning to optimize plant growth in aeroponic systems. It uses sensors like pH, TDS, DHT22, and water temperature to collect real-time data. The desktop application enables real-time monitoring and visualization of the data. Random forest regression analyzes the collected data to predict pH and TDS levels, enabling precise nutrient adjustments for optimal plant growth.  This system has an inbuilt chatbot custom-trained for aeroponics, hydroponics, and aquaponics, along with a community website for user discussions and expert guidance.
