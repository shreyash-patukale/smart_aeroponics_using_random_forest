# Smart Aeroponics using Random Forest
This project integrates Automation and Machine learning to optimize plant growth in aeroponic systems. It uses sensors like pH, TDS, DHT22, and water temperature to collect real-time data. The desktop application enables real-time monitoring and visualization of the data. Random forest regression analyzes the collected data to predict pH and TDS levels, enabling precise nutrient adjustments for optimal plant growth.  This system has an inbuilt chatbot custom-trained for aeroponics, hydroponics, and aquaponics, along with a community website for user discussions and expert guidance.

# Interface
## 1. Homepage
Displays real-time values for pH, Total dissolved solids(TDS) in Parts per million(PPM), humidity, room temperature, and water temperature. Below these values, graphical representations are displayed for better visualization of trends.

## 2. Prediction
Random Forest predicts trends based on the data accumulated, allowing early adjustments to pH, TDS, and environmental factors. Making changes in advance helps prevent imbalances, reducing issues in plant growth and ensuring healthier development.

## 3. Bioponics Chatbot (Grow Wise)
Grow Wise is a custom-trained chatbot designed for Aeroponics, Aydroponics, and aquaponics. It provides expert guidance, answers user queries, and offers insights on plant care and system management. Built using the Gemini model, it was trained on a diverse dataset to offer accurate, context-aware responses.
